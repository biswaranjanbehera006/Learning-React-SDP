      <p>
        This project is built using React and React Router with a focus on
        accessibility and inclusive design. It demonstrates how accessibility
        principles can be applied in real-world front-end applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by
        ensuring that content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and
        robust for all users.
      </p>

      <h2>Accessibility Principles Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Semantic HTML elements for structure</li>
        <li>Keyboard-accessible navigation</li>
        <li>ARIA roles and attributes where appropriate</li>
        <li>Focus management for dynamic content</li>
      </ul>
    </>
